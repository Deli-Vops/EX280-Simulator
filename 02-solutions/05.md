# Exercise: Configure HPA for a deployment in OpenShift

**Objective:** Configure a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for a deployment in OpenShift to automatically scale pods based on CPU or memory usage.

## Requirements and Steps

- A project named confucio.

```bash
oc project confucio
```

---

- A deployment named kungfu-panda.

```bash
oc describe deployment kungfu-panda
```

### 1. Configure HPA for a deployment 

Use an HPA to scale the kungfu-panda deployment in the Confucio project. Watch it grow from one to five replicas when the CPU usage hits 50%, faster than a panda chasing bamboo! Even Confucius would be impressed!

---

```bash
oc autoscale deployment kungfu-panda --min=1 --max=5 --cpu-percent=50
```
