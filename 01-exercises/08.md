# Exercise: Fix a deployment that doesn't work

**Objective:** Fix the deployment that mysteriously stopped working. Its status is 'pending'.

## Requirements and Steps

- A project named whell.
- A deployment named bbs.

### 1. A broken deployment

You have been notified of an alert because the `bbs` deployment has stopped working on the `wheel` project. You have no further information, and your colleague has told you that they `haven't touched anything`. (sure...)

Your objective is to investigate why the deployment is in pending status and apply the necessary solution to resolve the issue.

### Notes

- You **can't** delete the deployment.
- You **can't** create a new deployment.
- You **can only** edit a deployment that is currently active.
