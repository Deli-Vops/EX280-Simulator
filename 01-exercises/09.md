# Exercise: Diagnose a Deployment that Doesn't Start in OpenShift

**Objective:** Investigate why the `tribu` deployment in the `comanche` project fails to start and determine what is missing or misconfigured to get the pods running.

## Requirements and Steps

- A project named `comanche`.
- A ServiceAccount named `comanche-sa`.
- A Deployment named `tribu`

### 1. Deployment and Service Account

You have the `tribu` deployment applied in the `comanche` project which is using the service account `comanche-sa`.

For no apparent reason, the pod for the `tribu` deployment is either pending or in CrashLoopBackOff mode. Investigate what is missing to deploy it.

### Notes

Review the pod's logs for more information.
